~~~~~~~
009 (2006-07-30)

* Update panel icon to show volume level
* Add private volume-level icons from GnomeSVG theme
* Update tooltip to show current volume level

008 (2006-01-15)
* Converted to ALSA interface.  Volume-007 is the last to support OSS.
* Fixed error handlers in AppRun/AppletRun.

007 (2005-10-12)
* Options now editable from the AppMenu.
* New Icon?

006 (2004-05-22)
* Input from Cyrille Mars: mouse scroll-wheel on Panel icon changes volume without clicking.
* Input from Jonatan Liljedahl: option to show a progress bar on the Panel indicating the current volume setting (Options to show/hide the icon and/or progress bar)

* Resizes with the Panel properly.
* Launch the Mixer from the popup menu

005 (2004-04-20)
* Figured out how to save/restore the checkbox states for lock, mute and rec
* Figured out the whole get|set_recsrc thing. (I think)
* Made the checkbox labels translatable.

004 (2004-04-18)
* Factored out the VolumeControl widget and used in both Volume and Mixer.
* Lots of configurable things via masks to VolumeControl()
* Applet control is now 0-100 instead of 0-1 and has finer steppings.
* Follow panel orientation.
* Separate options for Mixer with hide/show each channel.
* Option to show values on Mixer sliders.

003
* Wrote a real Mixer app to replace the gnome-volume-control wrapper.
  UI is a straight rip of gnome-volume-control (for now at least). Needs
  some polish, but it works.

* Fixed a small bug reported by Antiphon with Sawfish (popup slider
  was being positioned wrong)

002
* Added options dialog and settings for mixer device (e.g. /dev/mixer)
  and the channel to control (e.g. PCM or Master volume)

* Changed the popup positioning to always be at the top of the panel
  and centered (?) on the icon. Still need to handle Left, Right and Top panels.

* Fixed a small bug in findrox.py.

001  First release
